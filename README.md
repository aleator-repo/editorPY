Universe Database Editor

UniVerse is an extended NoSQL relational data server optimized for embedding in vertical applications. UniVerse offers a nested relational (MultiValue) data model which means intuitive data modeling with fewer resulting tables.

The idea of this project is to be able to edit the records, either simply valued or multi-valued from a web page.

Python is mainly used with the uopy library, developed by Rocket for this type of database.

User, permissions, and connections to different installations will be supported soon
